# SwitchReversingTools
Just some tools I worked on to make my job easier

Nothing tutorial on how to use anything, mix of python 2 and python 3. A bunch of tooling i've used in reverse engineering the Nintendo Switch & developing some things for yuzu. This isn't all of what i've used but only a small handful.
